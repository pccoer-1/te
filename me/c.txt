  {$sort:{avgMarks:-1}}
]);
```

### 🧩 **Indexes**

```javascript
db.student.createIndex({name:1});
db.student.getIndexes();
```

### 🧩 **MapReduce Example**

```javascript
var map = function(){ emit(this.city, this.marks); };
var reduce = function(key, values){ return Array.sum(values)/values.length; };
db.student.mapReduce(map,reduce,{out:"avgMarks"});
db.avgMarks.find();
```

### 🧩 **Exit**

```javascript
